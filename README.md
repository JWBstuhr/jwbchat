# JWBchat
Online chat meant to work with CC: Tweaked and Skynet.

### Using JWBchat
JWBchat is fairly intuitive. The main menu is operated with WASD/Arrow Keys and Enter. You'll need to set up a username and a channel to connect to. You can also change audio settings. These are all saved, and don't have to be input every time it's opened.

You can attach a speaker for sound, if wanted. It can also just be turned off.

Install with:

`wget https://github.com/JWBstuhr/jwbchat/raw/main/jwbchat.lua`


Useful with [CraftOS-PC](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/).
